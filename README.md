## Vitoria Lima

I work on AI products and systems, with a focus on turning technical ideas into real, usable things.

I have a Master’s degree in Computational Science and Engineering from Harvard and a background across machine learning, applied research, and forward-deployed AI. I enjoy operating close to the product surface, making bets on ideas, testing them quickly, and pushing them toward production.

This space is a home for product bets, experiments, notes.
